This is a work in progress.

master branch is my original Sinclair-only visualization

tribune-merger branch includes Tribune data

gh-pages mirrors the tribune-merger branch

This is my first data visualization project. I started with [Simon Zou's Nielsen DMA map](https://github.com/simzou/nielsen-dma) as a base, since it was a readily available map of Nielsen regions. Then I wrote a [script](https://github.com/calvinkosmatka/table_scraper) to scrape Wikipedia's pages for Sinclair and Tribune owned/operated TV stations.

There are still a few janitorial issues with this data: 
* Some of the stations have a footnote reference number in place of the year they were acquired. These stations always show up on the map and are always included in the count.
* At least a few Sinclair-owned stations are missing, such as those in Corpus Christi, TX.
